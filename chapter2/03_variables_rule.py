#There are some rules for naming variables in Python:
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# 2. A variable name cannot start with a number.
# 3. A variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

name = "John"
_name1 = "Doe"
# @name = "Jane" error
# 2name = "Smith" error

# name@n ="Doe" error
